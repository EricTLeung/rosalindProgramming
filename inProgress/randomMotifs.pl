# Program 'randomMotifs'
# Given: A positive integer N <= 100000, a number 0 < x < 1, and
#     a DNA string 's' of length at most 10 bp
# Return: The probability that if N random DNA strings having the
#     same length as 's' are constructed with GC-content 'x', then
#     at least one of the strings equals 's'. We allow for the same
#     random string to be created more than once.
