Programming Solutions to Rosalind.info Problems
==================

This folder holds scripts that were used to complete problems from this website (www.rosalind.info). The website gives programmers/scientists a way to test their programming skills in implementing bioinformatic algorithms to solve problems. 

The scripts are written in Perl. each scripts takes in input as a text file, which it then parses through in order to compute an output to solve the problem.

All scripts are written by Eric Leung.
