# Programming Solutions to Rosalind.info Problems

This folder holds scripts that were used to complete problems from this website
(www.rosalind.info). The website gives programmers/scientists a way to test
their programming skills in implementing bioinformatic algorithms to solve
problems. 

The scripts are written in Perl, Python, and any other language that interests
me. Each scripts takes in input as a text file, which it then parses through in
order to compute an output to solve the problem.

All scripts are written by Eric Leung.
