# Programming Solutions to Rosalind.info Problems

This folder holds scripts that were used to complete problems from this website
(www.rosalind.info). The website gives programmers/scientists a way to test
their programming skills in implementing bioinformatic algorithms that solve
biological problems.

Each scripts takes in input as a text file, which it then parses through in
order to compute an output to solve the problem.
