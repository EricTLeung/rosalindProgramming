rosalindProgramming

This folder holds scripts that were used to complete problems from the
website www.rosalind.info, which is filled with bioinformatics algorithms.

The scripts are written in Perl. Each script takes in input as a text file,
which it then parses through in order to compute an output to solve the
problem.
